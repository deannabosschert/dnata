## Viewing a training
> Viewing a training is simple.

When the server is online, go to:

`SERVER_IP/view/TRAINING_NAME/SLIDE_X`

Where _`SERVER_IP`_ is the ip at which the server runs, _`TRAINING_NAME`_ is the name of the training, and _`SLIDE_X`_ should be the number of the slide you want to view (indexing starts at 1).

## Editing a training
> Editing a training is simple.

When the server is online, go to:

`SERVER_IP/edit/TRAINING_NAME`

Where _`SERVER_IP`_ is the ip at which the server runs, and _`TRAINING_NAME`_ is the name of the training. No slide index is needed because it will load all of them for you.
