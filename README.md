## Viewing a training
- Viewing a training is simple.
When the server is online, go to:
SERVER_IP/view/TRAINING_NAME/SLIDE_X
Where SERVER_IP is the ip at which the server runs, TRAINING_NAME is the name of the training, and SLIDE_X should be the number of the slide you want to view (indexing starts at 1).

## Editing a training
- Editing a training is simple.
When the server is online, go to:
SERVER_IP/edit/TRAINING_NAME
Where SERVER_IP is the ip at which the server runs, and TRAINING_NAME is the name of the training. No slide index is needed because it will load all of them for you.
